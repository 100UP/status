::: update Update | 2021-03-12T20:11:25.268Z
OVH will take several weeks or more to bring the services in Strasbourg online again.

We have ordered new servers in Roubaix to temporarily restore all affected customers servers there. Sadly there is also no ETA for deliveries in Roubaix, but it should be around 15th March.
